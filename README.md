-   **Scene Data**: Each area maintains its own tile and object states

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Core Systems

-   **TileManager**: Handles crop growth, tile states, and farming mechanics
-   **SceneTransitionManager**: Manages day transitions and scene loading
-   **InventoryManager**: Controls item storage and UI interactions
-   **StaminaManager**: Tracks and regenerates player energy
-   **CutsceneController**: Manages story sequences and dialog

### Save Data Structure

```csharp
- GameSaveData
  ├── Tile data by scene (crop states, growth phases)
  ├── Inventory data (backpack + toolbar)
  └── Current day progression
```

### Supported Platforms

-   **Unity Version**: 2021.3.45f1
-   **Target Platforms**: PC (Windows), with potential for mobile adaptation
-   **Rendering**: Universal Render Pipeline (URP)

## 🎯 Gameplay Loop

1. **Morning**: Wake up in your bed, plan your farming activities
2. **Farming**: Plow fields, plant seeds, water and tend crops
3. **Exploration**: Move between different areas and scenes
4. **Harvesting**: Collect mature crops for resources
5. **Evening**: Rest in bed to advance to the next day
6. **Progression**: Watch crops grow and story unfold over 7 days

## 🌾 Crop System Details

### Growth Phases

Each crop follows this progression:

1. **Seeding** (Day 0) - Just planted
2. **Phase 1** (Day 1) - Initial sprouting
3. **Phase 2** (Day 2) - Early growth
4. **Phase 3** (Day 3) - Mid development
5. **Phase 4** (Day 4) - Pre-harvest
6. **Harvest** (Day 5+) - Ready for collection

### Supported Crops

-   **Tomatoes**: High-value crop with longer growth cycle
-   **Rice**: Staple crop for consistent harvests
-   **Cucumbers**: Fast-growing vegetable
-   **Cabbage**: Leafy green with moderate growth time

## 🎨 Art & UI

### Visual Style

-   **2D Pixel Art**: Charming retro-inspired graphics
-   **Tile-Based World**: Clean, organized farming areas
-   **Animated Sprites**: Character and crop animations
-   **UI Elements**: Custom inventory, stamina, and dialog interfaces

### User Interface

-   **Inventory Grid**: Visual item management
-   **Stamina Bar**: Real-time energy tracking
-   **Dialog System**: Story text with skip options
-   **Scene Transitions**: Smooth video-based day changes
